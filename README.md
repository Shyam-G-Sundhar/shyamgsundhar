### **Notes for Enhancements**
- **Theme-based Mode**: GitHub’s theme (light or dark) automatically applies for users, making your profile viewable in both light and dark modes without needing extra code.
- **Dynamic Stats**: Stats like streaks and top languages can dynamically update, making your profile constantly fresh.
- **Colorful Badges**: Shields.io badges will stand out with vibrant colors.

#### Enjoying GitHub in **Dark Mode**?  
Your stats and colors automatically adjust to match your theme preference (light or dark) for a beautiful viewing experience.

Let me know if you'd like any further changes or have specific customization requests! This approach focuses on dynamic and vibrant elements while adhering to GitHub's functionality.
